Universal system configuration interface for operating systems (i.e. Solus)

`usysconf` provides a centralised configuration system to replace "package hooks" and post-installation triggers with a reentrant binary, suitable for use in recovery situations. It requires a certain development approach, by throwing away traditional postinstalls, and centralising/minimising the amount of system delta generated during these steps.

The binary replaces the legacy [COMAR system](https://solus-project.com/2017/11/12/this-week-in-solus-install-48/) in Solus with a single point for all configuration to take place. A simple state file tracks the `mtime` for interesting file paths, and when those are invalidated triggers are run in response. This allows `usysconf` to be the final execution step in any package/update operation, and incremently apply trigger steps to the system.

Lastly, a CLI interface is provided allowing users to forcibly run well known triggers by name (or all) to assist in recovery. This allows users to not worry about the inaccessible triggers of the past, and instead request usysconf run all triggers that need running. Optionally, all triggers can be run, bypassing update time checks:

```bash
$ sudo usysconf run -f
```

`usysconf` is a [Solus project](https://solus-project.com/)
